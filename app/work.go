/*
The Work System

The work system is a simple system that allows users to earn currency by working. It's designed as a way
to experiment with stateful applications in bytebot using only the core features of the framework.

Normally, sane people here would use a real database to store state. But we're not sane people.

At this point in time, the work system is pretty simple. Punch the clock, get paid. No cooldown. It's a start.

Right now what I'd like to see is just that users can work, get paid, and check their balance. Eventually we
can add a cooldown, and maybe even a way to check how long until you can work again.
