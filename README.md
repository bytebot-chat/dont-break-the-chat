# Don't Break the Chat!

Don't Break the Chat! is an interactive chat-based game for Bytebot that has no real purpose other than being a playground for the bot's features. It's a work in progress, and we aren't sure if we'll ever finish it. Maybe it shouldn't be finished?

We promise:

- Hilariously broken features
- A lot of bugs
- Easter eggs
- Some stability, maybe

## How to play

_This game is only playable via Discord by communicating with the bot._

1. Add the bot to your server with [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=853394505625632768&permissions=67584&scope=bot)
2. Start by sending a message to bytebot#8280 with the word "start" in it. Then, just follow the prompts. If you get stuck, send a message to bytebot#8280 with the word "help" in it.

We don't really have an API or commands or anything yet, so you might not get much back. We're working on it.
