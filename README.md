# Don't Break the Chat!

Don't Break the Chat! is an interactive chat-based game for Bytebot that has no real purpose other than being a playground for the bot's features. It's a work in progress, and we aren't sure if we'll ever finish it. Maybe it shouldn't be finished?

We promise:
    - Hilariously broken features
    - A lot of bugs
    - Easter eggs
    - Some stability, maybe

## How to play

_This game is only playable via Discord by communicating with the bot._

I honestly have no idea yet how this will be played. Start by sending a message to bytebot#8280 with the word "start" in it. Then, just follow the prompts. If you get stuck, send a message to bytebot#8280 with the word "help" in it.
